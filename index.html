    <h1>Project Team 20: Housing Equality, COSI 116A F24</h1>

    <p><strong>Ruixue Gou</strong>, <strong>Yenyi Lee</strong>, <strong>Chupei Yan</strong></p>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a
        href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis
        University</a>.</p>


    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>
      Housing affordability has become a critical issue in the United States, impacting millions of individuals and
      shaping the economic and social fabric of communities. As the cost of living rises and housing prices surge,
      understanding the disparity between renting and owning a home is essential for addressing housing inequality and
      informing policy decisions. Our project stems from a desire to explore the trends and disparities in housing
      affordability across regions, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      To develop this visualization, we identified the needs of several key user groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Policymakers:</strong> They require clear, reliable data to craft housing policies aimed at improving
        affordability and reducing economic inequality. Understanding trends in rent-to-income and mortgage-to-income
        ratios can help prioritize regions requiring intervention.</li>
      <li><strong>Real estate professionals:</strong> They need insights into regional disparities and temporal trends
        to guide investments and market analyses.</li>
      <li><strong>Prospective homeowners and renters:</strong> This group seeks actionable information to evaluate the
        financial implications of renting versus owning a home in different states.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By addressing these needs, our visualization aims to answer motivating questions such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How have rent and mortgage burdens evolved over time across the United States?</li>
      <li>Which states or regions are experiencing the highest housing burdens?</li>
      <li>How do housing burdens correlate with median income levels?</li>
      <li>Are there discernible patterns or trends that can guide housing affordability initiatives?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This focus aligns with the broader goal of highlighting housing inequality and empowering stakeholders to explore
      trends interactively and derive meaningful insights.
    </p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

    <p>The analysis examines trends in median monthly owner costs (mortgage), median gross rent, and median income
      across U.S. states from 2015 to 2023, excluding 2020. Data was sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS)
      1-Year Estimates using the U.S. Census Bureau API. Variables of interest include median monthly owner costs
      (DP04_0101E), median gross rent (DP04_0134E), and median income (DP03_0062E). Data preprocessing involved fetching
      data for each year and variable, transforming API responses into pandas DataFrames, renaming columns for clarity,
      merging datasets by state, and adding a "Year" column to track trends. Duplicate or unnecessary columns were
      removed, and all years' data was combined into a single dataset for analysis. Additionally, we calculated the
      percentage of rent-to-income and mortgage-to-income to evaluate housing affordability trends.
    </p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p>The tasks are categorized into data preparation, visual encodings, interactions, and project page design, all
      aimed at developing an interactive visualization to analyze housing affordability trends.</p>

    <p><strong>Data preparation</strong> involves researching and identifying relevant data sources, such as Census.gov,
      extracting raw data on income, rent, and mortgage statistics, and performing cleaning and preprocessing to ensure
      consistency and usability in subsequent analyses. This step ensures the data is accurate, relevant, and
      well-structured for visualization tasks.</p>

    <p><strong>Visual encodings</strong> focus on creating intuitive and informative representations of the data.
      Dropdown menus will allow users to select cost burden types (rent, mortgage, or income) and specific years,
      dynamically updating the visualizations based on user inputs. Choropleth maps will display state polygons with
      shading that reflects cost burden levels, providing an immediate visual representation of regional differences.
      Bar and line charts will complement these maps, offering historical trends and comparative insights, with detailed
      axes, legends, and marks to clarify the data.</p>

    <p><strong>Interactions</strong> enhance the usability of the visualizations by enabling tooltips that reveal exact
      data values on hover, zooming and panning features for map exploration, and brushing on bar charts to select and
      highlight specific time ranges. These features ensure users can explore the data interactively and gain deeper
      insights into housing affordability patterns.</p>

    <p>Finally, <strong>project page design</strong> will provide an accessible entry point for users, introducing the
      projectâ€™s objectives, significance, and the methodology behind the analysis. Together, these tasks aim to create
      an engaging, informative, and user-friendly platform for understanding housing affordability challenges across the
      United States.</p>



    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <h2>Initial Sketches and Iterative Development</h2>
    <p>
      Our design process began with rough sketches to conceptualize the layout and interaction features. The initial
      design included a static choropleth map to visualize regional disparities in housing costs, accompanied by bar and
      line charts to show temporal trends. These sketches helped us define key components, such as dropdown filters for
      selecting cost burden types and years, and interactive tooltips to display state-specific details.
    </p>

    <h2>Iterative Improvements</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Dropdown Interaction:</strong> Early feedback revealed that users wanted more control over data
        exploration. We added dropdown menus for year and metric selection, enabling dynamic updates to the
        visualizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Choropleth Map:</strong> Initially, the map's color gradient lacked clarity for users. We improved
        interpretability by using colorblind-friendly palettes and providing a well-labeled legend.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tooltips:</strong> Our first implementation of tooltips was static and cluttered. We refined the
        tooltips to display only the most relevant information, improving usability and aesthetics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bar and Line Charts:</strong> The charts underwent significant enhancements, including clearer axis
        labels, legends, and marks. Interactivity was added through brushing, allowing users to highlight specific time
        ranges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ranking Table:</strong> To further enhance the user experience and provide actionable insights, we added
        a new feature: a ranking table displayed on the right side of the interface. This table dynamically updates
        based on the selected year and metric (mortgage, rent, or income) from the dropdown menus.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Data Preparation and Integration</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure the map and charts correctly displayed housing trends, we carefully integrated datasets from the
      American Community Survey (ACS) via the U.S. Census Bureau API. This process involved several key steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Collection:</strong> We fetched data for the relevant metrics (median monthly owner costs, median
        gross rent, and median income) for each year from 2015 to 2023, excluding 2020.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> We transformed API responses into structured pandas DataFrames, ensuring
        consistency in column names, handling missing values, and standardizing state identifiers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Merging:</strong> The datasets for each year and metric were merged based on state names, creating
        a comprehensive dataset with columns for state, year, and each metric. This allowed for seamless integration
        across visualizations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Derived Metrics:</strong> To evaluate housing affordability trends, we calculated additional metrics
        such as rent-to-income and mortgage-to-income ratios. These derived metrics provided deeper insights into
        regional disparities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combined Dataset:</strong> All preprocessed data was combined into a single dataset, allowing the
        choropleth map and charts to dynamically update based on user-selected filters.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This rigorous data preparation ensured the accuracy and usability of the visualizations, aligning with our goal of
      creating an intuitive and informative platform for exploring housing affordability.
    </p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>Through this interactive visualization, we successfully analyzed and presented housing cost burdens in the United States from 2015 to 2023. By integrating data on rent, mortgage, and income, we highlighted regional and temporal trends in housing affordability. Key features like the choropleth map, bar and line charts, and ranking table provided users with an intuitive and dynamic exploration tool.</p>
    
    <p>One major finding from our analysis is the relative stability of housing cost burdens at the national level. Mortgage burdens have consistently hovered around 30%, while rent burdens remained around 19-20%. However, deeper exploration at the regional level could uncover areas where disparities are more pronounced, pointing to potential policy interventions.</p>
    
    <p>Looking ahead, there are areas for improvement and future work. Incorporating additional metrics, such as housing supply, cost of living, and demographic factors, could provide a more comprehensive picture of housing inequality. Enhancing interactivity, such as adding state-specific time trends or drill-down features, would further enrich the user experience. Finally, expanding the scope to include localized data at the city or county level could uncover more granular insights.</p>
    
    <p>In conclusion, this project serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, real estate professionals, and individuals to better understand housing affordability challenges. It provides a foundation for future research and development, with the potential to inform data-driven decision-making and promote housing equality.</p>
